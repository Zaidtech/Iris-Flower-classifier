# Iris-Flower-classifier
  A simple ML project using Logistic Regression.

# Used:
  Octave/ Matlab as the programming language

I use a training set with 150 training examples (50 for each type)

Features included:-
1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal width
4. Petal length

I trained the algorithm to perform multiclass-classification.
